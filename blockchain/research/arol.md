### Arol's Ideas

- Transportation companies could intervene in the blockchain and use webhooks to confirm delivery.
- The network and the society in general are not prepared for the blockchain.
- **The peers in the contract should be the ones to acknowledge completion of the contract.**
- Use stripe to transfer money.
- Escrow service?

Maybe there are **five actors**:

- Coffee producers
- Coffee consumers (coffee shops)
- Shipping companies
- Banks
- Us as the central entity

The blockchain is what links them all.

### What Arol Wants for Monday (blockchain)

- What network to use?
- Why this network?
- What does a transaction mean?
- How many modifications in the same transaction?
- Who are going to be the peers and why?
- What is the place of the back-end?

### Questions for Arol

- How distributed the blockchain network is? i.e. is there still a central entity or can we remove it entirely?
