# Blockchain for Coffee

## Defining the Idea

- Gives all stakeholders - farmers, roasters, and consumers - access to data across the entirety of the supply chain.

### Moyeecoffee

At the point of collection, the bext360 platform instantly creates cryptotokens, which represent the value of the commodity.

As the commodity flows through the entire  supply chain, new tokens are automatically created. These tokens  increase in value as the beans move through the supply chain. This  step-by-step process makes the entire chain transparent, and makes  sharing the value added easier.

It was bext360’s tokenization technology that caught the interest of the FairChain Foundation and Moyee founder,[Guido van Staveren](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guidovanstaverenvandijkmoyee/), in the first place.

Currently  patent-pending, this technology promises drastic reductions in the  transaction costs of global commodities. Bext360’s tokens can be used  for inventory valuation and to streamline the certification processes by  reducing paperwork and physical inspectors, which can cost up to €0.80  per a pound of coffee.

The bext360 platform provides full transparency which can eliminate this costly part of the supply chain.

#### Benefits of the blockchain

[Tony Winters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/uooka/),  a member of Beerchain, a Dublin-based blockchain meetup, recently  summed up the main benefit that blockchain technology provides in just  one word: Trust.

Many coffee  certification schemes, while well-meaning, simply do not provide the  transparency that coffee consumers are demanding. Nor, in many cases,  are they having the impact[ that they claim.](http://thesourcefilm.com/)

Blockchain literally connects you with our  farmers. With blockchain, the coffee industry suddenly has no more  secrets. And by getting rid of all the unnecessary middlemen, our  farmers receive more money.
